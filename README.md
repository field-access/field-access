## 🧭 About Me

I’m a passionate developer blending creativity with code. From building VB6 projects to designing full-stack apps with **React and Supabase**, I explore tech that’s both nostalgic and cutting-edge. I believe in **learning by doing**, whether it's crafting a sweet shop management system, prototyping AI crowd platforms, or designing clean UI/UX experiences.

I aim to build tools that make people's lives simpler and more efficient—always keeping it user-first.
